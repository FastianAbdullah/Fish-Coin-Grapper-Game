Welcome to my Fish Eats Coins Game Project, developed during my 3rd semester in Assembly Language  at FAST NUCES. This project is a fun and addictive game where you control a fish that swims
 around and eats coins to score points.

In this game, you control a colorful fish that swims around in an underwater environment. The fish can move in any direction and must collect coins to increase
 its score.

This project was developed using [Assembly Language]. It demonstrates my proficiency in [Core Programming], including [Assembly in 3rd semester]. 
The project code is available for viewing and can be downloaded and modified as needed.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my Fish Eats Coins Game Project!
